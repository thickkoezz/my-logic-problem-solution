[Day 11: Santa's Snowy Algorithm](https://www.rustfinity.com/practice/rust/challenges/aor-2024-11/description)

_"LISTEN UP, YOU MAGNIFICENT, STRESSED-OUT CODERS!" Santa bellowed. "Tomorrow, we test the sleigh again. And this time, it WILL work. No more Florida nonsense. Palm trees are NOT part of the Christmas aesthetic."_

He pointed dramatically at Bernard and Pepper. ‚ÄúYou two are coming with me. If the sleigh glitches mid-flight again, I want live debugging happening in real time. No excuses.‚Äù

The elves whispered nervously. Everyone still remembered the "Florida Incident"‚Äîlast week‚Äôs failed test landing in a snowless golf course. Santa didn‚Äôt appreciate the HOA complaints.

‚ÄúThis time,‚Äù Santa continued, pacing, ‚ÄúSnowball compiled every scrap of data we need for each location. Top-notch metrics. But metrics mean nothing without an algorithm. Your job is to write a function to find the snowball-densest landing spot.‚Äù

## Your mission

Snowball has provided you with a `Vec<Location>`, now the other elves need to write a function to find the most dense area with snow.

Here is what you need to do:

Write a `new()` associated function for the `Location` struct that takes `x: f64`, `y: f64`, `z: f64`, `area: f64`, and `snow`.
The `snow` parameter must be able to accept all `SnowKg`, `SnowLb` and `Snowball` types.
Implement a method for the `Location` struct named `density()` that gets the density of snow in the location.
Finish the `find_best_location` function which takes a `Vec<Location>` and returns a `Result<Location, Box<dyn Error>>`.
That's it! üéÖ

## Hints

If you‚Äôre stuck or need a starting point, here are some hints to help you along the way!

- When we implemented the `From<T>` trait in the previous challenge, Rust automatically implemented the `Into<T>` trait for us. This means that if you implement `From<T>` for a type, you can convert that type to T using the into() method. e.g. `let snow = snow.into();`.
- For the `snow` parameter, you can accept anything that implements the `Into<Snowball>` trait. e.g. `new(x: f64, y: f64, z: f64, area: f64, snow: impl Into<Snowball>) -> Self`. Here `impl Into<Snowball>` means any type that implements the `Into<Snowball>` trait.
- Convert the `snow` parameter to a `Snowball` type using the `into()` method. e.g. `let snow = snow.into();`.
- Implement the `density()` method for the `Location` struct. The density of snow is calculated by dividing the snow weight by the area of the location. Make sure you handle the division by zero case.
- Use `into_iter` to convert the `Vec<Location>` to a consuming iterator. e.g. `locations.into_iter()`.
- Use the `max_by()` method to find the location with the highest density of snow. e.g.

```
locations
  .into_iter()
  .max_by(|a, b| {
    a.density()
      .partial_cmp(&b.density())
      .unwrap_or(Ordering::Equal)
})
```

- Import `Ordering::Equal` using `use std::cmp::Ordering`.
- Use the `ok_or()` method to convert the `Option` returned by `max_by()` to a `Result`. e.g. `ok_or("No locations found".into())`.
